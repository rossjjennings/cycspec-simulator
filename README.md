# Cycspec Simulator
Cycspec Simulator is a set of tools for simulating and testing various approaches to cyclic spectral analysis for pulsar timing. It is structured as an installable Python package. To install the package, first clone this repository:

For development purposes, it is often useful to make an editable install:
